"Am I my thoughts, the thoughts that I am thinking? No.  Thoughts come and go;  I am not my thoughts. Am I my body?  They tell us that millions of cells in our body are changed or are renewed every minute, sothat by the end of seven years we don't havea single living cell in our body that was there seven years before.  Cells come and go.  Cells arise and die.  But I\ seems to persist.  So am I my body?  Evidently not\""""",4,5,5,3
